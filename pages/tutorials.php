        It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML provides a set of tags and attributes that define the structure and content of a webpage. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee and released in 1993.
        html - The root element of an HTML page. All other elements are contained within it.
        head - Contains metadata about the webpage such as title, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
        title - Sets the title of the webpage (appears in the browser tab).
        body - Contains the visible content of the webpage such as text, images, links, etc.

    "JAVA": `   <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language used in web development, mobile applications, and enterprise systems.Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It follows the Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) principle, meaning that Java code can be compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 style="font-size:30px !important"><u>KEY FEATURES:</u></h3><br>
        <h3>Platform Independence</h3>
        <h3>Object-Oriented</h3>
        <h3>Robust Security</h3><br>
        <br>
       <u  style="font-size:30px !important"> Nature and Characteristics of Java :</u><br>
Java is statically typed, meaning that variable types must be declared at compile-time, unlike dynamically typed languages such as Python or JavaScript. It is also strongly typed, preventing implicit type conversions that could lead to unexpected behaviors. Additionally, Java is a multi-threaded language, which allows concurrent execution of tasks to improve performance in applications such as servers, games, and desktop software.<br>



<br>
<u  style="font-size:30px !important">Compilation and Execution Process :</u><br>
Java follows a two-step execution model:<br>

Compilation: Java source code (.java file) is compiled by the Java compiler (javac) into bytecode (.class file).<br>
Execution: The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) interprets the bytecode and executes it on the target system.
This approach makes Java platform-independent, as the same compiled code can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as the system has a compatible JVM.<br>
<br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java :</u><br>
Java is fundamentally object-oriented, meaning that everything in Java revolves around classes and objects. The four main OOP principles in Java are:<br>

Encapsulation: The practice of restricting direct access to data and methods by using access modifiers (private, protected, public).<br>
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities through abstract classes and interfaces.<br>
<br>
Inheritance: <br>Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class using the extends keyword, promoting code reusability.<br>
Polymorphism:<br> Allowing methods to have multiple implementations, either through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) or method overriding (runtime polymorphism).<br><br>
<br>
<u style="font-size:30px !important">Memory Management and Garbage Collection</u><br>
Java automatically manages memory using a garbage collector (GC), which eliminates the need for explicit memory deallocation. The JVM continuously monitors object references and removes unused objects, preventing memory leaks. However, developers should still be cautious with object references to avoid unintentional memory retention.<br>
<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Exception Handling in Java :ðŸ˜Š</u> <br>
Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism to manage runtime errors and maintain application stability. The try-catch-finally block allows developers to handle unexpected conditions gracefully, while the throws keyword is used to propagate exceptions to calling methods.
<br><br>
<u style="font-size:30px !important">Multithreading and Concurrency</u><br>
Java supports multithreading, which enables parallel execution of tasks to improve performance. The Thread class and Runnable interface allow developers to create and manage threads efficiently. Java also provides synchronization mechanisms, such as synchronized methods and the volatile keyword, to avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
<br><br>
<u style="font-size:30px !important">Java Standard Library and Frameworks</u><br>
Java comes with an extensive standard library (java.lang, java.util, java.io, etc.), which provides built-in support for data structures, file handling, networking, and more. Additionally, Java has powerful frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX, which simplify enterprise application development.

       <u style="font-size:30px !important"> Nature and Characteristics of Python</u>:<br>
Python is designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers alike. It follows a multi-paradigm approach, supporting procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not require compilation before execution, making development and debugging faster.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Dynamic Typing and Memory Management</u>ðŸ˜›:<br>
Unlike statically typed languages such as Java or C++, Python is dynamically typed, meaning that variables do not need explicit type declarations. The Python interpreter determines the type at runtime based on the assigned value. Python also uses automatic memory management, including garbage collection, to handle memory allocation and deallocation.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Python's Execution Model</u>:ðŸ˜Š<br>
When a Python script is executed, the Python interpreter processes the code line by line. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode generated from the script, ensuring portability across different platforms. Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which impacts multi-threaded applications.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python</u>:<br>
Python is object-oriented, meaning it organizes data and behavior into objects and classes. The four main OOP principles in Python are:<br><br>

Encapsulation:<br> Restricting access to data using private (__variable) and protected (_variable) attributes.
Abstraction:<br> Hiding implementation details using abstract classes and interfaces.
Inheritance: <br>Allowing one class to inherit attributes and methods from another using the class DerivedClass(BaseClass): syntax.
Polymorphism: <br>Enabling methods to take different forms through method overloading and method overriding.
Python also supports multiple inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from more than one parent class, unlike Java.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Memory Management in Python</u>:<br>
Python uses a heap memory structure where all objects are stored. It employs an automatic garbage collector that uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to free up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Exception Handling</u>:<br>
Python has a built-in exception handling mechanism to manage runtime errors gracefully. The try-except-finally block is used to handle exceptions, preventing abrupt program termination. Developers can also define custom exceptions by inheriting from the Exception class.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Python's Standard Library and Modules </u>:<br>
Python comes with a rich standard library, including modules for file handling, networking, data manipulation, and more. Additionally, developers can install external libraries using pip. Some of the most popular Python libraries include:<br>

NumPy and Pandas (Data Science)</u><br>
Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data Visualization)<br>
TensorFlow and PyTorch (Machine Learning & AI)<br>
Django and Flask (Web Development)<br>
Requests (Web Scraping & API Handling)<br>
Functional Programming in Python<br><br>
Python supports functional programming, which treats functions as first-class citizens. Key features include:<br>

Lambda functions (lambda x: x * 2)<br>
Map, filter, and reduce functions<br>
List comprehensions and generator expressions<br>
Python also supports decorators, which allow modifying function behavior dynamically.<br>

    "C++": ` <div style="color:white !important">
     C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming (OOP) language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the C language, adding features like classes, objects, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance while maintaining C's efficiency and low-level memory manipulation capabilities.C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language that extends C with object-oriented programming (OOP), generic programming, and stronger type checking. Understanding its theoretical aspects helps in compiler design, system programming, and high-performance computing.

     <u  style="font-size:30px !important">Basic Syntax & Program Structure  ðŸ˜Š:</u><br>
A simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!":<br>


#include <iostream>  // Header file for input-output operations<br>
using namespace std; // Allows use of standard library names directly<br>

int main() {<br>
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Prints text to console<br>
    return 0;  // Returns 0 to indicate successful execution<br>
}<br><br>
<u  style="font-size:30px !important">Explanation:</u><br><br>

#include <iostream> = Includes the input-output stream library.<br>
using namespace std; = Allows usage of standard library names without std.<br>
int main() = The main function, where execution starts.<br>
cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; =Prints text to the screen.<br>
return 0; = Indicates successful execution.<br>

   <u  style="font-size:30px !important"> Nature and Characteristics of C++ ðŸ˜›: </u><br><br>
C++ is often described as a middle-level language because it combines both low-level (hardware-level) and high-level (abstraction-level) features. Unlike dynamically typed languages like Python or JavaScript, C++ is statically typed, meaning that variables must be declared with a specific type at compile time.<br>

C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including:<br><br>

Procedural Programming (like C)<br>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)<br>
Generic Programming (via Templates)<br>
Functional Programming (via lambda functions and the STL)<br>


<u  style="font-size:30px !important">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++</u><br><br>
C++ introduced OOP concepts that allow for better code organization and reusability. The four fundamental OOP principles in C++ are:<br>

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within classes while restricting direct access using private, protected, and public access modifiers.<br><br>
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities through abstract classes and interfaces.<br><br>
Inheritance: Allowing new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes using the class Derived : public Base syntax.<br><br>
Polymorphism: Enabling functions to have multiple forms through function overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and function overriding (runtime polymorphism via virtual functions).<br><br>

<u  style="font-size:30px !important">Conclusion</u><br><br>
C++ is a powerful, efficient, and versatile programming language that combines low-level system access with high-level abstraction. It is widely used in applications that demand high performance and control over system resources, such as game development, embedded systems, and financial modeling.<br>

"PHP":`<div style="color:white !important">
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and has since evolved into one of the most widely used languages for building dynamic web applications. PHP is embedded in HTML and interacts with databases, making it a fundamental part of backend web development.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Nature and Characteristics of PHP</u><br>
PHP is a loosely typed, interpreted, dynamically typed, and procedural/OO language. Some of its key characteristics include:<br>

Server-side Execution: PHP code runs on a web server, generating HTML dynamically before sending it to the client.<br>
Interpreted Language: No compilation step is needed; the PHP engine processes scripts on the fly.<br>
Cross-platform: PHP runs on multiple operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.<br>
Embedded in HTML: PHP can be mixed with HTML and executed within a web page.<br>
Supports Multiple Paradigms: PHP allows procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.<br>
<br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">PHP Execution Model</u><br>
When a client requests a PHP page:<br>

The request is sent to the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).<br>
The PHP interpreter processes the script.<br>
PHP interacts with databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL).<br>
The final HTML output is sent back to the clientâ€™s browser.<br>
Unlike JavaScript, which runs in the browser, PHP executes on the server, making it suitable for backend logic, authentication, and database management.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">PHP Syntax and Code Execution</u>
A PHP script typically starts with:<br>

php<br>
Copy<br>
Edit<br>


<u style="font-size:30px !important">Security in PHP</u><br>
To build secure PHP applications, consider:<br>

SQL Injection Prevention: Use prepared statements.<br>
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Use htmlspecialchars().<br>
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Implement CSRF tokens.<br>
Hashing Passwords: Use password_hash() instead of storing plain text passwords.<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Conclusion</u><br>
PHP remains a powerful and widely-used language for server-side web development. Its ability to handle dynamic content, database integration, and session management makes it ideal for building web applications, CMS platforms (like WordPress), and e-commerce sites.<br><br>

"EXPRESS.JS":`<div style="color:white !important">
Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs by providing a set of powerful features. Express is widely used for backend development, particularly in RESTful API and full-stack applications (such as those using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).
<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Nature and Characteristics of Express.js ðŸ˜Š</u>
<br>
Express.js is:<br>

Minimal = Provides only essential features, allowing developers to add middleware and customize functionality.<br>
Fast = Built on Node.js, it handles asynchronous operations efficiently.<br>
Unopinionated = Unlike frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Express does not enforce a specific project structure or design pattern.<br>
Middleware-based = Uses middleware functions to process requests and responses.<br>
Supports Routing = Provides a built-in router to handle different HTTP methods and URL paths.<br><br>


<u style="font-size:30px !important">Middleware in Express.jsðŸ˜›</u><br>
Middleware functions process HTTP requests before sending a response. Middleware can:<br>

1.Log requests<br>
2.Parse JSON data<br>
3.Handle authentication<br>
4.Serve static files<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Types of Middleware :</u><br>
1.Application-level Middleware = Applies to all requests.<br>
2.Router-level Middleware = Used for specific routes.<br>
3.Built-in Middleware = Like express.json() for parsing JSON.<br>
4.Error-handling Middleware = Handles errors centrally.<br>

<br>
<u style="font-size:30px !important">How Express.js Works</u><br>
Express sits on top of Node.js and simplifies HTTP request handling. A basic Express server:<br>

<br>

const express = require("express");  // Import Express<br>
const app = express();  // Create an Express application<br>
<br>
app.get("/", (req, res) => {<br>
  res.send("Hello, World!");  // Respond to GET request<br>
});<br>

app.listen(3000, () => {<br>
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");<br>
});<br>
Explanation<br>
1.express() creates an instance of the Express application.<br>
2.app.get() defines a route for the root (/) URL.<br>
3.res.send() sends a response to the client.<br>
4.app.listen(3000) starts the server on port 3000.<br>

"REACT.JS":`<div style="color:white !important">
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed by Facebook (now Meta) and released in 2013. React is component-based, meaning it allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.
<br><br>
<u style="font-size:30px !important">Core Principles of React.js</u><br>
 Component-Based Architecture<br>
React applications are built using components, which are reusable pieces of UI. Each component manages its own logic and rendering.<br>

Example of a functional component ðŸ˜Š:<br>

function Greeting() {<br>
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;<br>
}<br>
Each component returns JSX (a syntax extension of JavaScript that looks like HTML).<br><br>

<u style="font-size:30px !important">Virtual DOM </u><br>
Instead of updating the real DOM directly (which is slow), React uses a Virtual DOMâ€”a lightweight copy of the real DOM.<br>

When a componentâ€™s state changes, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing).
It then updates only the changed parts in the real DOM (reconciliation).
This process improves performance and makes React fast.<br><br>


<u style="font-size:30px !important">Key Features of React.js</u><br>

Component-Based Architecture =React applications are built using independent, reusable components that manage their own state and logic.<br>

Declarative UI = Instead of imperatively updating the DOM, React allows developers to describe the UI state and ensures efficient updates.<br>
Virtual DOM = React maintains an in-memory representation of the UI, updating only the changed elements, which enhances performance.<br>
One-Way Data Binding = Data in React flows in a single direction, making debugging and state management more predictable.<br>
State and Props = Components manage their own internal state (state) and receive external inputs (props).<br>
Hooks = Functions like useState and useEffect allow functional components to manage state and lifecycle events, replacing class-based components.<br>
React Router = Provides navigation for single-page applications without reloading the page.
Integration with APIs = React can fetch and update data dynamically from RESTful APIs, making it ideal for dynamic web applications.<br>
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG) = Enhances SEO and performance using frameworks like Next.js.<br>
React Native = Enables mobile app development using the same component-based architecture.<br><br>



<u style="font-size:30px !important">React Lifecycle</u><br>
React components go through different lifecycle phases:<br>

Mounting =Component is created and inserted into the DOM.<br>
Updating =Component re-renders when state or props change.<br>
Unmounting =Component is removed from the DOM.<br>
